# The Shrine of Space Filling Curves

*You know why you are here if you are here*

Peano curves are a fascinating mathematical concept that can fill a space with a continuous, non-repeating path. They were first discovered by Giuseppe Peano in 1890 and have since been studied for their unique properties.

These curves can be thought of as a way to map a one-dimensional line onto a two-dimensional space, like a square. The result is a complex and beautiful pattern that challenges our intuition about space and geometry.

The Peano curve is just one example of a broader class of mathematical objects known as space-filling curves. These curves have been used to study topics like topology and geometry, and have even inspired art and design. Despite their complexity, Peano curves can be constructed using simple iterative processes, making them a fascinating area of study for mathematicians and non-mathematicians alike.
